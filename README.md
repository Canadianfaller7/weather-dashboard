# Weather Dashboard

## Description
- This is a web application that allows the user search for the weather in their current city or anywhere else they would like!

- As I went through this project, I was able to learn more about how to use jquery and how to really understand how an API call works and how I can utilize the infromation provided into my own code by sifting through the returned information and saving them to variables to show that information on my own website.
- Here is a link to view the full site: [Weather Dashboard](https://canadianfaller7.github.io/weather-dashboard/ "Named link title")

## Installation
